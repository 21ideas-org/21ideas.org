In <a href=/en/ba/1>Part I</a>, we defined the First Law of Bitcoin Astronomy and described how it leads to new blockchains as humanity expands through the solar system. In <a href=/en/ba/2>Part II</a>, we described a Second Law which leads to nested blockchains the size of solar systems and beyond, hashing vast energies on cosmic timescales.</p><p>Though we did discuss interstellar colonies and blockchains, we focused our attention in Parts I & II on our solar system and species. In this part, we expand our perspective to include the whole galaxy and the other species and civilizations that may already call it home.</p><p>We begin with a warning about the dangers of generalizing about other civilizations when we have only our own civilization as an example. Yet we will press on regardless and speculate that aliens, assuming they exist, are likely to develop blockchains of their own. Our galaxy may be full of technological, communicating, proof-of-work hashing alien civilizations.</p><p>What will happen when we detect their block headers?</p><h2 id=the-mirror-of-universality>The Mirror of Universality
<a class=anchor href=#the-mirror-of-universality>#</a></h2><blockquote><p><em>“Perhaps the most valuable part of [these] extraordinary [speculations] is going to be the mirror with which we confront ourselves obliquely…as we try to ask the question “What the future is like?"</em></p><p>— Philip Morrison, Prof. of Physics, MIT (<a href="https://youtu.be/cQeOp7a8QMI?t=926">source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Our speculations about extraterrestrial life are always biased by our understanding of ourselves. <a href=https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/everydaylife/jamestown-water-fs.html>NASA’s maxim</a> for finding life in our solar system — <em>Follow the water</em> — assumes life elsewhere requires liquid water because all life on Earth does.</p><p>Similarly, our speculations about alien civilizations are biased by our own culture, technology and history. The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (<a href=https://www.seti.org/>SETI</a>) assumes aliens are talking to us because we ourselves like to be heard. SETI listens for narrow-band radio signals because that’s how we communicate here on Earth.</p><p>We cannot escape our biases, but we can temper them with the knowledge that alien life and civilizations, should they exist, must operate by the shared rules of our common universe. If our speculations are to avoid anthropomorphism, we must identify <em>universals</em> — properties which are likely to characterize life and civilization anywhere they occur.</p><p>Unfortunately, our sample size of one biosphere with one (young?) civilization makes it difficult to define such universals. Though all life on Earth shares the same liquid water-based biochemistry, this is no guarantee that life elsewhere must do so. And though radio waves are a natural technology for interstellar communication, it’s possible that ours is the only civilization to use them. The vast scale of the universe and the tremendous variation it contains potentially means there <em>are no</em> universals that characterize life and civilization.</p><p>We <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis>may be completely alone in the universe</a>, a temporary statistical fluke in entropy production needing neither explaining nor purpose. Or perhaps the universe is full of life that is incomprehensible to our physics and biology; beings we cannot grasp experiencing realities we cannot conceive.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-639.png><p><em>“When you look into the mirror it is not ET you see, but reflections of yourself posed universally.” — John Updike on SETI.

<a class=anchor href=#life-is-common>#</a></h3><p>But that doesn’t mean we have no objective basis from which to begin our speculations.</p><p>The fossil record confirms that simple life began on Earth almost immediately after our planet cooled.  Either <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis>life can evolve from matter</a> quickly or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia>life was already around</a>, waiting to settle in.  Life on Earth also survived several mass extinctions due to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_basalt>geological processes</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event>biofeedback</a>, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_impactor>asteroid impacts</a>.  This means life is hardy; where the conditions are right, it persists.</p><p>Astrobiologists increasingly believe that conditions are <em>frequently</em> right for life.  Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and the life-sustaining molecules they form are the most common substances in the universe and we know there are millions, potentially billions, of rocky planets just like Earth orbiting stars just like our Sun in our galaxy alone.</p><p>Carbon-based, water-soluble <a href=https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2020/05/19/the-odds-on-intelligent-life-in-the-universe/>simple life is probably common</a> in our galaxy.  If we allow ourselves to entertain the possibility of other, more exotic kinds of life, then life should only be <em>more</em> common.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-640.png><p><em>Simple life such as found in this hydrothermal system in Dallol, Ethiopia, is probably common across the galaxy.

<a class=anchor href=#the-fermi-paradox>#</a></h3><blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;A sad spectacle. If they be inhabited, what a scope for misery and folly. If they be not inhabited, what a waste of space.&rdquo;</em></p><p>— Thomas Carlyle on stars</p></blockquote><p>But what about complex life, the kind we believe can evolve intelligence and civilizations?</p><p>Civilizations, like life itself, are active agents, transforming their environments and declaring their presence to the cosmos through methods both intended (signals & probes) and unintended (waste heat).  The traditional wisdom of astrobiology, confirmed by decades of fruitless SETI searches, is that such civilizations cannot be common, as common as we suspect life to be, simply because we would have noticed them by now.  This tension between how common life seems to be and the lack of any (credible) evidence of alien intelligence is sometimes referred to as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox>the Fermi Paradox</a>.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-641.png><p><em>The “Fermi Paradox” supposedly originated in an offhand remark made by physicist Enrico Fermi during a lunchtime conversation about aliens. The galaxy is huge and old and intelligence has had many opportunities to evolve — so “Where is everybody?” [<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi>Source</a>]</em></p></div><p>The Fermi Paradox isn’t really a paradox at all.  A simple, if disappointing, “solution” to the “paradox” is that ours is the only intelligence in the galaxy.</p><p>Another, more optimistic solution is that we simply haven’t looked very hard.  The galaxy is vast and we have expended few resources searching it for signals.  It is possible for our galaxy to be home to thousands of alien civilizations at various levels of technological advancement yet for us to be completely oblivious to them all.</p><p>These are but two of the most straightforward solutions.  There are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#Hypothetical_explanations_for_the_paradox>many others</a>, ranging from bleak (it is the nature of civilization to destroy itself), to terrifying (elder, predator civilizations exterminate all younger ones) to whimsical (our solar system is an interstellar zoo).</p><p>An entire class of proposed solutions relies upon the idea of a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter>Great Filter</a>: something that prevents matter from evolving into communicating, technological civilizations.  Great Filters are evolutionary, sociological, or technological barriers that many or most forms of life and civilizations never surmount, explaining why the galaxy is so quiet.  Examples include the evolution of multicellular life, or intelligence or the ability to survive exponential population growth and environmental degradation after industrial revolutions.</p><h3 id=cosmic-sociology>Cosmic Sociology
<a class=anchor href=#cosmic-sociology>#</a></h3><p>Solutions to the Fermi Paradox often make general statements about the motivations and behaviors of all possible extraterrestrial civilizations, yet we lack any examples of civilizations other than our own — so how can we possibly generalize?</p><p>We can’t.  Building a sociological theory of extraterrestrial civilizations through an inductive, data-driven scientific process is impossible.  If we are to construct believable solutions to the Fermi Paradox, we must use a more deductive method.</p><p>In his novel, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest><em>The Dark Forest</em></a>, the science-fiction author Cixin Liu gives a name to this mode of deduction: “Cosmic Sociology” (no doubt a department in the same building as Bitcoin Astronomy).  As one character explains, when there is “nothing concrete to study” and “surveys and experiments aren’t possible,” then the “ultimate result will be purely theoretical.”  She goes on to describe “axioms” – what we would call universals — which she believes characterize extraterrestrial civilizations.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-642.png><p><em>Cixin Liu’s The Dark Forest may reveal more about its author or US-China politics than it does about the Fermi Paradox.

<a class=anchor href=#blockchains-are-universal>#</a></h2><p>What do we see when we look in the mirror?  It’s clear that we <em>want to</em> see blockchains.  But it’s no fun to simply declare that blockchains make reasonable universals for technological civilizations — we must motivate this conclusion somehow.</p><p>Bitcoin arose on Earth from other, proximate technologies to solve coordination problems.  If these proximate technologies and coordination problems themselves are universal, then blockchains should be common through convergent evolution.</p><p>Looking in the mirror again, let us practice cosmic sociology and begin with some more conservative universals. Communicating, technological civilizations.</p><ol><li><strong>Have a society.</strong>  Civilizations are composed of separate individuals acting out of rational self-interest with imperfect information.</li><li><strong>Have finite resources.</strong>  Civilizations are constrained by finite supplies of matter and energy.</li><li><strong>Have no magic.</strong>  No civilization possesses technologies we consider impossible today (e.g. instantaneous communication or travel).</li></ol><p>(1) means we’re not considering hive minds or perfectly-coordinated machine-intelligences — not because they cannot exist, but because we cannot understand their evolution or motivations.</p><p>Similarly (2) means we discount civilizations such as <em>Star Trek’s</em> Federation, where replicators can create anything one wishes and where money is obsolete because the only scarcity is the Captain’s chair.</p><p>On the contrary, no matter how advanced a civilization’s technology or culture, by (3) they must play by the same rules as we do.  They must have limited resources and unlimited ambitions.  Like us, they must still develop mechanisms for the allocation of scarce resources across competing individuals and conflicting interests.</p><p>Let’s see how a conservative choice of universals (1) – (3) leads to the convergent evolution of bitcoin-like blockchains among communicating, technological civilizations.</p><h3 id=social-species-use-language--money>Social species use language & money
<a class=anchor href=#social-species-use-language--money>#</a></h3><p>Should we ever detect an extraterrestrial signal, we would hope for it to be a message created by language users like us.  Oherwise all it tells us is “<a href=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-edward-snowden-got-wrong-about-eavesdropping-on-aliens/>We are here and we have a transmitter.</a>”</p><p>On Earth, the development of language was deeply intertwined with the evolution of social species such as humans.  One of the reasons for our assumption (1), that alien civilizations are social species, is that we believe this makes them more likely to develop language and desire communications with other social species.</p><p>But social species are also more likely to develop money.  In <a href=https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/>Shelling Out</a>, Nick Szabo traces the evolutionary connections between money, cooperation, and competition in early human societies.  Inventing money “enabled early modern humans to solve problems of cooperation that other animals cannot.”  If the concept of money increases the fitness of social species then, like language, it may be a common adaptation evolved by successful social species.</p><p>Once it evolves, money may even drive the evolution of language.  Some of the earliest known examples of written human language are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform>Sumerian clay tokens and tablets</a> which record ancient transactions and debts.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-643.png><p><em>Clay tablets are ledgers which enable communication between civilizations across thousands of years of time.

<a class=anchor href=#prerequisite-technologies-are-universal>#</a></h3><p>This can only happen if the prerequisite technologies for blockchains such as telecommunications, computing, and cryptography are also universal.</p><p>There are good reasons to believe that telecommunications and computing are universal developments in any technological civilization.  Social species that expand to cover their home planet or solar system will not do so without building telecommunications networks.  Computing is required for automating large societies and solving difficult problems of space science.  Both technologies are intimately related, each benefiting from progress in the other.  Besides, civilizations that don’t develop these technologies won’t be able to send or receive signals, so we’ll consider them to be reasonable universals.</p><p>What about cryptography?  Cryptography arose on Earth from the need to keep secrets.  Individuals in social species are likely to keep secrets, whether to collaborate with others or just to preserve their own privacy.  As social species develop technologies such as writing or communication networks, they will develop techniques to transmit secrets securely.  If aliens keep secrets, they’ll invent cryptography.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-644.png><p><em>P != NP means there exist questions with answers that are difficult to find but easy to check. This allows the cryptographic locks and keys that blockchains rely upon. [<a href=https://pixabay.com/illustrations/cyber-security-protection-technology-3400657/>Source</a>]</em></p></div><p>The particulars of alien cryptography might differ from ours.  They might not use <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve>elliptic curves</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic>modular arithmetic</a>, but many computer scientists and mathematicians <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=122">believe that P != NP</a>, which implies that questions with answers that are difficult to find but easy to check will always exist.  Technological advances (such as quantum computers) may make it easier to find answers to certain classes of questions, but there will never exist a machine or algorithm which can efficiently answer every question.  This means cryptography is universal.</p><p>So if alien civilizations use money and develop telecommunications, computing, and cryptography, they’ll have the necessary prerequisites to invent blockchains.  But how do we know that they won’t eventually invent something better?</p><h3 id=the-third-law>The Third Law
<a class=anchor href=#the-third-law>#</a></h3><p>A fundamental assumption of this series is that proof-of-work blockchains such as bitcoin are the optimal form of money.  There <em>is</em> nothing better.</p><p>Blockchains with “more powerful” virtual machines, which “get around” proof-of-work, or employ “quantum magic” don’t exist or are bad ideas.  The finite speed of communications, the energy costs of proof-of-work, and the long timescales of block settlement are essential features of bitcoin and all successful blockchains.</p><p>Consider the two “laws” we proposed in Parts I & II of this series:</p><p><strong>The First Law of Bitcoin Astronomy (or “<strong><strong><em>The Law of Hash Horizons</em></strong></strong>”):</strong> Given constant hashrate, as a miner moves away from the center of hash of a blockchain, the number of blocks won by that miner statistically trends towards zero.</p><p><strong>The Second Law of Bitcoin Astronomy (or “<strong><strong><em>The Hash Exclusion Principle</em></strong></strong>”):</strong> Discrete physical and temporal scales provide hierarchical states for blockchains to occupy in order of increasing energy and distance from Earth.</p><p>The First Law implies that blockchains are limited by the speed of light to have a finite size related to their block time.  But this limitation incentivizes remote distant human colonies to build their own blockchains and defends them against aggression from incumbent empires. This encourages human expansion.</p><p>Similarly, the Second Law forces successful blockchains to occupy a discrete spectrum of energy scales, sizes, and locations.  This constraint ensures cooperation rather than competition between blockchains, political groups, or people of different energy scales, locations, and time preferences.  Discrete blockchains bootstrap our civilization up the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale>Kardashev scale</a>, a necessary requirement for us to become an advanced, space-faring civilization capable of settling nearby stars.</p><p>Bitcoin’s constraints are not limitations that civilizations eventually evolve or innovate past.  They are fundamental drivers of human — and alien — growth and innovation.</p><p>Alien species which evolve language, money, telecommunications, computing, and cryptography should also develop a bitcoin-like blockchain through convergent evolution.  They will then experience their own version of hyperbitcoinization.  This will also cause them to expand through their solar system and ascend the Kardashev scale.  Blockchains are universal because hyperbitcoinization-induced expansion increases a species’ evolutionary fitness.</p><p>Viewed at an even grander scale, life is a process which increases its internal order by exploiting free energy gradients.  Life is robust and common because it is thermodynamically favorable: the waste heat it produces has higher entropy than the energy it consumes.</p><p>Species which evolve blockchains increase internal order, energy usage and entropy production from planetary to interstellar scales.  This makes blockchains thermodynamically favorable adaptations as well.</p><p>We summarize these conclusions in a Third Law of Bitcoin Astronomy, the last of this series:</p><p><strong>The Third Law of Bitcoin Astronomy (or “<strong><strong><em>The Law of Hash Universality</em></strong></strong>”):</strong> Proof-of-work blockchains such as bitcoin are a universal adaptation among communicating, technological civilizations.</p><p>The rest of this article pursues the consequences of the Third Law for SETI, first contact, and the Fermi Paradox.</p><h2 id=blockchains-are-the-signal>Blockchains are the signal
<a class=anchor href=#blockchains-are-the-signal>#</a></h2><p>Let us assume that technological civilizations are numerous and long-lived enough in the galaxy so that each should expect to interact with several others during its lifetime.</p><p>Just as we tend to assume alien civilizations know about radio waves and nuclear fusion, taking the Third Law seriously means we should assume that each of these civilizations also knows about and uses blockchains.</p><p>There’s a general belief among SETI researchers that, should humanity actually discover or interact with another alien civilization then it’s likely for that civilization to be far more technologically advanced than we are.</p><p>The combination of these ideas leads us to speculate that the first SETI signal humanity will detect will be an alien blockchain.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-645.png><p><em>Humanity has already transmitted sound money into space.

<a class=anchor href=#xenocoin-transmissions-are-commonplace>#</a></h3><p>One reason Nakamotans are likely to send us Xenocoin is that Xenocoin blocks & transactions are already some of the most common and powerful transmissions in their interstellar communications networks.</p><p>The archetypal “Hello” first contact messages in science fiction originate from elder civilizations and are broadcast in every direction through space.  They are cosmic lighthouses, greeting young civilizations as they enter the galactic community.</p><p>But omnidirectional broadcasting on the interstellar scale isn’t cheap, it requires <a href=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna3753843>hundreds of trillions of watts</a>, many times more energy than used by our entire civilization today.  Even advanced societies such as Nakamotans, who perhaps can afford such an energy expense, will probably instead choose more efficient methods of communication.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-647.png><p><em>Interstellar communications networks are unicast, peer-to-peer, and lack delivery guarantees.

<a class=anchor href=#blockchains-are-schelling-points>#</a></h3><p>But compression is just one simple example of the more general idea that limited virtual machines are a good way to communicate between species.  Blockchain interpreters are limited virtual machines.  This is another reason why Nakamotans will send us Xenocoin.</p><p>If a message contains an arbitrary virtual machine, say one for decompressing data (as in our example above), we are still left with the question of how to interpret its output.  Even if we could find a way to structure this output as symbolic, audio, and/or visual information, how could we interpret <em>that</em>?</p><p>This is ultimately a problem of semiotics.  To communicate in natural language, senders and receivers must share signs, combinations of signifiers (symbols, sounds, images, gestures) and things signified — ideas and concepts such as “We come in peace” or “Here is how to build a warp drive.”  The difficulty of this problem shouldn’t be underestimated: the film <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_%28film%29>Arrival</a> spends much of its airtime on the characters learning how to interpret alien signs.</p><p>One way to reduce the difficulty of the semiotic problem is to restrict the universe of discourse.  Instead of being able to signify any possible thing, if signs were assumed to be about a fixed number of classes of things signified then they would be easier to interpret.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-649.png><p><em>Early computer language programs restricted their universe of discourse.

[<a href=https://twitter.com/santiontanon/status/1252848639325507584>Source</a>]</em></p></div><p>But the Nakamotans can’t tell us in advance how to limit our universe of discourse because we can’t communicate.  That’s the problem we’re solving!  Somehow, species must converge on the same universe of discourse without prior communication.  There must exist a natural <a href=https://nav.al/schelling-point>Schelling point</a> for how to limit the shape and subject of an initial interstellar conversation.</p><p>We’ve discussed above that virtual machines are a natural way to communicate across space and so they form the structural half of this Schelling point: messages are programs.  But species must also converge on the semantic half of the Schelling point: what does the program do?</p><p>The Third Law provides the answer.  If all species use blockchains then <em>blockchains are a Schelling point for the semantics of interstellar programs</em>.  The Nakamotans will send us the Xenocoin blockchain because they will assume that we will interpret any message we receive as a blockchain — because <em>that’s what they would do</em>.  Reaching this Schelling point accomplishes three simultaneous objectives.</p><p>First, blockchain interpreters are limited by design: bitcoin’s <a href=https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script>Script</a> is designed to halt on all inputs and consume a bounded amount of resources.  Assuming first contact messages are blockchains decreases the risk senders ask receivers to take when implementing virtual machines to interpret their messages.</p><p>Second, reducing the universe of discourse to the paucity of concepts required to implement a blockchain greatly reduces the semiotic problem.  While an interstellar blockchain such as Xenocoin is vastly greater in scale and hashrate than bitcoin, it operates on the same principles.  If some signifier seems to play the role of a public key then senders can confidently assume that the thing signified is the public key itself.</p><p>Blockchain interpreters such as bitcoin’s Script do contain complex cryptographic algorithms (such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2>SHA256</a> hashing or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm>ECDSA</a> signing) as primitive <a href=https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/Opcodes_used_in_Bitcoin_Script>opcodes</a>.  These algorithms aren’t likely to be universal across civilizations or blockchains, but if senders are already including a virtual machine for a blockchain interpreter, they can also include implementations of its cryptographic opcodes.  This is similar to how the <a href=https://bitcoin.org/en/download>core bitcoin software</a> distribution includes <a href=https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/secp256k1>custom cryptographic routines</a> alongside its virtual machine.</p><p>Finally, and most importantly, blockchain transactions are inherently opaque to all but their participants.  They contain no semantic content.  This relieves receivers from needing to interpret <em>what they mean</em>; we just need to <em>ensure they validate</em>.</p><p>If a message includes both blockchain interpreter and blockchain data then the two can be used to cross-validate each other, aiding in interpretation.  The ultimate proof that receivers correctly understand the message is when they validate for themselves that the Xenocoin blockchain meets the consensus rules of Xenocoin.</p><h3 id=the-medium-is-the-message>The medium is the message
<a class=anchor href=#the-medium-is-the-message>#</a></h3><p>But a blockchain isn’t just proof of successful transmission, it’s a self-validating history of a civilization’s economic activity.  Just as ancient Sumerian clay tablets help us understand the Sumerian civilization, a blockchain helps us understand the civilization transmitting it.  Nakamotans will send us Xenocoin because they want us to grok them.</p><p>A blockchain’s block time tells the receiver something about the physical scale of the sender’s civilization: block times of minutes for planetary blockchains, weeks for stellar, and centuries for interstellar blockchains such as Xenocoin.  The long timescale of Xenocoin is an open invitation: it means Xenocoin’s hash horizon is correspondingly large, big enough to include us, should we choose to join it.</p><p>A blockchain’s length, in combination with its block time, tells the receiver about the age and economic history of the sender’s civilization.  Are they a young Type I civilization with a stellar blockchain experiencing early monetization?  Or an advanced, Type II civilization such as the Nakamotans with a mature interstellar blockchain such as Xenocoin?  As we measure the velocity of distant stars through their <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_spectroscopy>Doppler shifts</a>, we will measure the velocity of distant monies through their <a href=https://unchained.com/hodlwaves/>HODL waves</a>.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-650.png><p><em>Imagine the HODL waves chart for an interstellar blockchain with a 500,000 year history. [<a href=https://studio.glassnode.com/>Source</a>]</em></p></div><p>A blockchain’s weight, the proof-of-work done to construct it, tells the receiver about the economy of the sender’s civilization.  Though the same virtual machine algorithm will require different amounts of real energy in different civilizations because of their different levels of computing technologies, a civilization can still estimate what it would cost them in compute and energy to mine the blocks they see in another civilization’s blockchain.</p><p>Any strong, repeating, narrow-band artificial signal the Nakamotans send us would be a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technosignature>technosignature</a> — proof to us of an alien civilization.  But a blockchain is a very special kind of self-validating, self-signifying technosignature.  It cannot be faked, except at astronomical expense, and it comes with its own built-in interpretation.  A blockchain is a thermodynamically signed, cryptographic proof of a civilization’s position on the Kardashev scale.</p><p>Sending us Xenocoin is a way for the Nakamotans to flex on us.</p><h3 id=blockchain-as-lingua-franca>Blockchain as lingua franca
<a class=anchor href=#blockchain-as-lingua-franca>#</a></h3><p>First contact is as much a meeting of markets as it is tribes or species.  Commerce is one of the chief drivers of exploration that causes distant tribes to meet in the first place.  And the history of commerce is full of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca><em>lingua francas</em></a>, specialized jargons which develop to facilitate trade between tribes that speak different languages.</p><p>A conversation between humanity and the Nakamotans taking place over light years with the goal of coming to mutual understanding, knowledge, and prosperity could take millenia.  Xenocoin serves as a lingua franca during this time.  It maintains the conversation until both sides develop a better shared language, one capable of more a meaningful exchange of ideas than transactions and blocks.</p><p>If we’re lucky, the Nakamotans will be willing to invest in learning how to have more meaningful conversations with us.  But the Nakamotans could be jaded or disinterested.  Perhaps they are used to promising, young civilizations that nonetheless collapse, never to be heard from again.  They’re willing to send us Xenocoin but they may not choose to make any further investments in learning our language till we prove ourselves worthy.</p><h2 id=first-contact>First Contact
<a class=anchor href=#first-contact>#</a></h2><p>Let us assume that one day humanity detects a strong, repeating, narrow-band signal from an unknown Nakamotan entity.  The signal is long and complex and is found to contain significant amounts of binary-encoded data.  This message is subsequently found to contain the Xenocoin blockchain and virtual machine specification.  How will our species react?</p><h3 id=blockchain-uplifting>Blockchain Uplifting
<a class=anchor href=#blockchain-uplifting>#</a></h3><p>The Third Law asserts that all technological civilizations will develop bitcoin but it doesn’t preclude that some civilizations might learn about it from others.</p><p>So let’s first consider a counterfactual scenario: what if humanity were to receive this signal <strong>before</strong> Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin?  Could we have deciphered it?</p><p>Obviously, if it were hundreds of years ago, we would neither have detected it nor been able to understand it.  But let’s assume the signal was received in 2005, years before bitcoin, but at a point in human history where encryption was already widely deployed on the Internet and cypherpunks had already experimented with projects such as <a href=https://www.hashcash.org/>HashCash</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_Dai#b-money>b-money</a>, & <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo#Bit_gold>bit gold</a>.</p><p>Satoshi described bitcoin in English and familiar mathematics and implemented it using common programming languages, yet it is still difficult for most humans to understand how bitcoin works — many don’t even try.  An alien blockchain might have been inscrutable.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-651.png><p><em>In a timeline where humanity received a Xenocoin signal before we invented bitcoin, we might get the Xenocoin white paper instead of the bitcoin white paper.</em></p></div><p>But wouldn’t that only have made it more fascinating?  Huge resources would have been spent by governments, universities, and corporations to “crack the signal”.  Despite lacking an example blockchain of our own, assume that we are able to understand that we’re dealing with a virtual machine which does cryptography on a dataset.  Someone (perhaps Satoshi!) would eventually have made the connection between proof-of-work, cryptographic money, and distributed ledgers.</p><p>The only hypothetical origin story for bitcoin more incredible than its real history would be that it was inspired by alien money from the stars.  Whether this origin would have hastened or slowed bitcoin’s creation or adoption is anyone’s guess.</p><h3 id=resistance-is-futile>Resistance is Futile
<a class=anchor href=#resistance-is-futile>#</a></h3><p>Thankfully, humanity already knows about bitcoin, so when we learn about Xenocoin we will be able to decipher it more quickly than if we had to figure out blockchains themselves first.  We will quickly perceive the scale, age, and power of the Nakamotan civilization.</p><p>These numbers are likely to be so large that they frighten us.  Entities with access to hashrate on such tremendous scales pose serious threats to human civilization.  What if they coordinated to send a hash bomb, destroying bitcoin, Muskcoin, Solcoin or another human blockchain?  What if they spent a similar amount of energy on real weapons?</p><p>Some elements of human society may despair or turn inward, believing the universe to be under a <em>Pax Nakamota</em> that provincial savages like ourselves should better avoid.  Others may urge faster industrialization and greater investment in our own blockchains.  Perhaps proof that a blockchain on the scale of Xenocoin can exist is what finally causes Solcoin to take off in our solar system: a mad idea suddenly proven right.</p><p>Others will realize that Xenocoin is an opportunity.  Humanity may not yet have launched an interstellar blockchain of our own and, if we were to do so, it would have to compete against Xenocoin.  Xenocoin’s far greater hashrate is likely to win.  The endgame is clear: if we can’t compete with the Nakamotans then we must join them.</p><h3 id=running-xenocoin>Running Xenocoin
<a class=anchor href=#running-xenocoin>#</a></h3><p>All we have to do to join the Xenocoin network is send Xenocoin back to the Nakamotan source we received it from.  This tells the Nakamotans we are receiving their messages and that we have a transmitter.</p><p>It also shows them we’re not going to noise up the channel with useless “Hello” or “What is the secret of life?” messages.  It lets them know we’re ready to participate more fully in their peer-to-peer network, in the Xenocoin blockchain.</p><p>Once they receive our response, the Nakamotan response might be to test us, sending us the occasional invalid Xenocoin transaction or block.  If we blithely transmit these back, they’ll know we don’t yet understand the protocol.  We might risk being put on a cosmic banlist for a few centuries.</p><p>But if, for many Xenocoin blocks, we consistently transmit back all valid transactions the Nakamotans send us, then they may begin to invest more resources in our relationship.  Perhaps they would begin transmitting more frequently, continuously instead of periodically.  We would respond in kind, committing more of our own energy budget towards maintaining this vital interstellar communications link.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-652.png><p><em>We will build powerful orbital communications lasers to constantly maintain our link to the Nakamotan civilization. [<a href=https://sunnyminj.artstation.com/projects/RxN2W>Source</a>]</em></p></div><p>At some point our Nakamotan peer would send us (or we might learn how to ask for ourselves) information about other Xenocoin peers.  We would send signals to them as well, hopefully receiving back responses decades later.  Each new peer we successfully connect to would lead us to discover its peers.  We may realize that our galactic neighborhood is full of Xenocoin using star systems, all willing to peer with us since we now share the same economic language.</p><p>Our civilization would have become a full node in the Xenocoin blockchain.</p><h3 id=using-xenocoin>Using Xenocoin
<a class=anchor href=#using-xenocoin>#</a></h3><p>It may take us centuries to become a well-connected Xenocoin node and to establish real communication with Nakamotan civilization.  As we do, we are likely to have many questions we’d like the Nakamotans to answer.</p><p>Nakamotans may be open with us and answer our questions freely.  They may be eager to communicate and willing to “uplift” our civilization.  But they may also be reticent to interact with us, wary of exposing us to knowledge or technology we aren’t ready for — perhaps with historical reasons for why they feel this way.</p><p>But the Nakamotans aren’t a single entity, they’re a heterogenous civilization like us.  They won’t act with complete uniformity and we needn’t rely upon their generosity.  If we possessed Xenocoin, we could purchase what we wanted from willing Nakamotan individuals, companies, or distributed exchanges.</p><p>There are significant incentives for humanity to acquire Xenocoin.  Factions of our civilization which do so first will wield significant power.  They might be able to buy scientific breakthroughs or blueprints for advanced technologies.  They might purchase training from Nakamotan educators for their engineers to build these technologies — or from Nakamotan defense contractors for their soldiers to wield them.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-654.png><p><em>What incredible knowledge or technologies might the Nakamotans possess?

<a class=anchor href=#mining-xenocoin>#</a></h3><p>But before we can spend or custody Xenocoin, we must possess some.  How will humanity earn Xenocoin in the first place?</p><p>If Nakamotans are curious about us they might value information about our civilization and species.  We might be savvy and view information about ourselves as the one asset we possess in greater abundance than an advanced civilization such as the Nakamotans.  A small bubble of human history data speculation might tickle Nakamotan markets for a few thousand years.</p><p>But, eventually, the entire human Internet will be pirated and sold to the lowest Xenocoin bidder.  And no matter how curious Nakamotans might have been about us, we’ll have little else to trade them that they don’t already know.</p><p>Nakamotans might be interested in acquiring human currencies.  We might not have an interstellar blockchain that can compete with Xenocoin but Solcoin or other human blockchains may be collectibles for Nakamotan elite or institutions.  Some Nakamotan investors might desire bitcoin just because of the memes.</p><p>If Xenocoin supports cross-chain atomic swaps then Nakamotan & human traders can trustlessly exchange Xenocoin and bitcoin, Solcoin, or the tokens of any other human blockchains.  Eventually, as trade between our civilizations increases, exchange rates will emerge between human currencies and Xenocoin.  These rates are interstellar valuations of the relative markets and prospects for Xenocoin and human blockchains.</p><p>The best way for humanity to earn Xenocoin, long-term, is for us to mine it.  The crucible of human civilization is likely to be many light years away from the Xenocoin center of hash near the Nakamotan home worlds.  But Xenocoin has a block time of centuries specifically so that civilizations like ours, many light years from the center of hash, can still mine.  Nakamotans want us to mine Xenocoin because they want Xenocoin to grow.  They might also be waiting for us to mine Xenocoin.  The ability to do so indicates our civilization is worth investing further resources in.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/ba-653.png><p><em>Distributed Xenocoin mining pools allow us to combine our civilization’s hashrate with the much greater hashrate of Nakamotan star systems. [<a href=https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant/Legends>Source</a>]</em></p></div><p>But given the huge hashrate of Xenocoin, mining any for ourselves will require joining a distributed Xenocoin mining pool.  Nakamotans themselves likely use such pools to mine Xenocoin across the various star systems of their civilization.  We could even join in pools with other Xenocoin using star systems.  Perhaps there exists a Xenocoin mining pool favored by young civilizations such as ours, spread far and wide in between the pockets of much larger civilizations that make up the Nakamotan sphere.</p><p>Depending on the gap between humanity and the Nakamotans on the Kardashev scale, we may need to allocate a significant fraction of our hashrate over millenia if we’re ever to earn out meaningful amount of Xenocoin from our mining pool.  Initially, few people will be willing to mine Xenocoin over Solcoin, bitcoin, or some other human blockchain.  A hyperbitcoinized society’s energy and mining industries are deeply intertwined and both extremely efficient.  In contrast, early human Xenocoin mining technology will be primitive and inefficient,  preventing it from being rapidly adopted by the mining industry at scale.</p><p>But over time, humans will develop Xenocoin ASICs to make our miners more competitive in the broader Xenocoin hashrate market.  And as we learn more about the Nakamotan civilization and what we can purchase with Xenocoin, our desire to possess it will increase.  The combination will lead to gradual adoption of Xenocoin mining across human civilization.  The long timescales of Xenocoin blocks means that few miners will dedicate 100% of their hashrate to Xenocoin — as discussed in Part II, the bitcoin and Solcoin markets will continue to exist and thrive.  Miners will apportion some fraction of their hashrate to planetary, stellar, and interstellar blockchains as they see fit.</p><p>We may not have created Xenocoin but Xenocoin may nonetheless become our civilization’s interstellar blockchain.  Even if we can’t communicate with the Nakamotans, we can still use Xenocoin within human civilization.  As an interstellar blockchain with a huge hashrate, Xenocoin is already suitable for optimizing human interstellar trade networks and allowing humans to store value and manage risk across the longest timescales.  It’s possible that the Nakamotan civilization is full of species that don’t communicate or trade greatly with each other but all use Xenocoin as their interstellar blockchain.  It is in this sense what we meant earlier when we said that Xenocoin really <em>is</em> the Nakamotan civilization.  By adopting and mining Xenocoin, we ourselves become Nakamotans.  We become a Type II civilization.</p><h3 id=returning-to-the-fermi-paradox>Returning to the Fermi Paradox
