Hint: Beyond Bitcoin, it’s ALL shitcoin.
I often get asked about “which crypto” is a good one to invest in. Of course, my answer is always bitcoin. Period.
In this article I’d like to lay out the rationale from three angles:</description></item><item><title>Inalienable Property Rights</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/inalienable-property-rights/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/inalienable-property-rights/</guid><description>This essay by Gigi was published on dergigi.com website.

Cypherpunks of the World,
Several of you at the &amp;ldquo;physical Cypherpunks&amp;rdquo; gathering yesterday in Silicon Valley requested that more of the material passed out in meetings be available electronically to the entire readership of the Cypherpunks list, spooks, eavesdroppers, and all. &amp;lt;Gulp&amp;gt;

Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn&amp;rsquo;t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn&amp;rsquo;t want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.
If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of their interaction. Each party can speak about their own memory of this; how could anyone prevent it?</description></item><item><title>Is Bitcoin Like the Dutch Tulip Bubble?</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/dutch-tulip-bubble/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/dutch-tulip-bubble/</guid><description>This article by Yan Pritzker was published on swanbitcoin.com website.

If you could use tulips to instantly transmit value across the globe to anyone in any country, regard­less of whether they had a functioning govern­ment or banking system.
If the govern­ment couldn’t come to your door and take away your tulips or control who you could sell them to or in what ways.
If tulips could last for hundreds of years or millennia and be handed down to your children, redeemed for other forms of value.</description></item><item><title>Everyone's a Scammer</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/everyones-a-scammer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/everyones-a-scammer/</guid><description>This article by Michael Goldstein was published on the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute website.

Suggested background reading music There&amp;rsquo;s a War Going On # Bonnie and Clyde cannot simply rob First National Block Chain. They can hack servers and unencrypted wallet files or scan low-entropy brain wallets. But the costs of obtaining bitcoins hoarded on a high-entropy, password-protected paper wallet, for instance, are incredibly high. A computer cannot be expected to brute force the wallet in the universe’s lifetime, so a trespasser would have to employ expensive tactics such as kidnapping and torture on any prospective, individual target.</description></item><item><title>The Freedom of Value</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/freedom-of-value/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/freedom-of-value/</guid><description>This article by Gigi was published on dergigi.com website.

How Value-for-Value Fixes the Monetization of Information # The internet has a problem. Few people know that this problem exists, but hey, that&amp;rsquo;s the nature of serious, non-obvious problems: they are invisible until they aren&amp;rsquo;t. The problem with the internet is that information wants to be free. And if something wants to be free as in freedom, given enough time, it will also be free as in beer.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Is The Only Real Meme</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/bitcoin-meme/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/bitcoin-meme/</guid><description>This thread by Gigi was published in his Twitter.

“This is our meme world, everyone else is just living in it.” With this quote by @bitstein I began my talk about “memes” and “the world” at the @BTCZitadelle this weekend.
My talk wasn’t about memes, since I wouldn’t be able to top Bitstein’s talk anyway.
It was about the difference between memes and the world.
Memes are thoughts, ideas, information.</description></item><item><title>The Number Zero and Bitcoin</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/number-zero-and-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/number-zero-and-bitcoin/</guid><description>This essay by Robert Breedlove was published in his Medium blog.

Satoshi gave the world Bitcoin, a true “something for nothing.” His discovery of absolute scarcity for money is an unstoppable idea that is changing the world tremendously, just like its digital ancestor: the number zero.

An open letter to the confused and dismissive.
It should be obvious by now, but I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I&amp;rsquo;ll have to spell it out anyway: Bitcoin, not blockchain. Bitcoin, not crypto. Bitcoin, not distributed ledger technology. Bitcoin, not DeFi. Bitcoin, not Web3. Bitcoin, not CBDCs. Bitcoin, not yield farming. Bitcoin, not centralized neo-banks that sell you fractional-reserve paper bitcoin.

Bitcoin provides strong assurances around the predictability and scarcity of its money supply. I wrote a detailed technical explanation of how it works here.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s controversial to state that this scarcity is one of bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s key properties and fundamental value drivers. If this property is violated, we have a big problem. So&amp;hellip;do we have a problem?</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin is The Mycelium of Money</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/bitcoin-is-the-mycelium/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/bitcoin-is-the-mycelium/</guid><description>This series by Brandon Quittem was published in his blog.

Foreward # I need to give credit to Dan Held for publishing his 4-part series comparing bitcoin’s origin to planting a tree. While I loved his series, I believe a more robust analogy is comparing bitcoin to fungi. If you’re new to this topic, strap in — it is my honor to initiate you into the fascinating world of fungi.</description></item><item><title>Proof of Life.

The definition of life has been a challenge for scientists and philosophers alike. While many definitions have been put forward, what precisely differentiates the living from the non-living remains elusive. Are viruses alive? DNA molecules? Computer viruses? Biologically produced minerals?
Ralph Merkle, inventor of cryptographic hashing and namesake of the Merkle tree, made the argument that Bitcoin is the first example of a new form of life.</description></item><item><title>A Most Peaceful Revolution</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/most-peaceful-revolution/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/most-peaceful-revolution/</guid><description>This article by Nic Carter was published in his Medium blog.

As ambassadors of Bitcoin, I believe we must speak the common tongue and avoid esoteric language so that our message can penetrate minds far and wide. Here, I will shed some light on the Bitcoin and cryptoasset universe in an exoteric nutshell. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin&amp;hellip;
When we look at the cryptoasset universe, there are two distinct hemispheres: 1) Bitcoin and 2) everything else, which are commonly known as Alternative Cryptoassets or Alts.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Dissidents</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/bitcoin-dissidents/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/bitcoin-dissidents/</guid><description>The global pandemic and interwoven political and economic crises became fertile ground for Bitcoin to become a tool for human rights.

Something special happened in the first year or so after Satoshi gave us Bitcoin, something no one expected and many thought was impossible. Try to imagine Bitcoin back then, before you could buy things with it, before there was an exchange rate, before anyone really knew what, if anything, would happen with it.</description></item></channel></rss>
