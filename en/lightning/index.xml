Lightning Network is a decentralized system for instant micro payments. Bitcoin, the world&amp;rsquo;s most widely used and valued cryptocurrency, allows anyone to transfer value without the need for a trusted third party. Bitcoin supports an advanced scripting system that allows users to program instructions for managing their funds.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Wallets</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/lightning-wallets/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/lightning-wallets/</guid><description>With repeated bumps of the popularity of monkey pictures in the Bitcoin blockchain and in anticipation of the upcoming bull market, fees in the mainnet don&amp;rsquo;t make anyone happy.
Fees in the network can reach hundreds of sats per virtual byte, and this is far from the limit. Source.
Lightning Network provides a solution to the painful problem of high fees, but you need to act thoughtfully, without hurrying. That&amp;rsquo;s why today I propose to analyze the best available Lightning wallets, evaluate the pros and cons of each of them, so that you can choose the best solution and finally forget (or at least minimize the stress) about high fees.</description></item><item><title>How Lightning Address Works</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/how-lightning-address-works/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/how-lightning-address-works/</guid><description>More experienced users know, that nowadays you can send satoshis directly to Lightning Address in user@domain format.

The Lightning Network has been growing recently, with around 11,000 active public nodes out of around 20,000 total. Besides the advantage of near-instant payments, there can be privacy improvements to Lightning as well. Unfortunately, there are scenarios where Lightning is not great for privacy.
I’d like to unearth some of these. Not as FUD about the network, but to keep people as informed as possible so they may privately use Lightning.</description></item><item><title>Is Lightning centralized?</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/is-lightning-centralized/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/is-lightning-centralized/</guid><description>Hold your horses, Darth will explain you how to &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; those charts.

OK plebs, by another request from my readers, they asked me to interpret / read this chart, being scared that the chart is showing that many LN nodes are “running” on Amazon, Google etc and LN is “cEnTrAlIzEd”.
I think originally this FUD was launched on internet by the XRP/ETH guys, trying to diminish the normies “trust” in Bitcoin and create panic.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Explained</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/lightning-network-explained/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/lightning-network-explained/</guid><description>This article by Dmitry Laptev was published in his Medium blog.

First, we discuss why we need it (part 0) and describe an idea of payment channels and Lightning Network (part 1). Then we introduce required building blocks (part 2) and see how these blocks can be used to create payment channels (part 3). We then finally build Lightning Network, discuss its properties (part 4), and sum it all up (part 5).</description></item><item><title>Solutions to inbound liquidity problem</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/inbound-liquidity-problem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/inbound-liquidity-problem/</guid><description>This article by Dmitry Laptev was published in his Medium blog.

If you want to accept payments through lightning network or to properly balance your channels — your node needs to have sufficient inbound capacity. This article describes what that is and practical ways to get it.
Update(July 2021): three years after it was written, this post is still mostly accurate, but some ways of getting inbound liquidity are missing or outdated.</description></item></channel></rss>
