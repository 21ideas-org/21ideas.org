&lt;p>I would like to share a guide on &lt;a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/">Phoenix&lt;/a> — the non-custodial Lightning wallet. This guide will be useful for those who already are familiar with the Lightning Network and have some experience using it. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;ve already been using a custodial wallet like &lt;a href="https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/">Wallet Of Satoshi&lt;/a> and you want to gain more control over your funds, hold your sats in Lightning Network, and &lt;strong>minimize&lt;/strong> the level of trust to a third party. I say &amp;lsquo;minimize&amp;rsquo; rather than &amp;lsquo;avoid&amp;rsquo; for a reason, but I&amp;rsquo;ll clarify this later in the guide.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Electrum Bitcoin Wallet</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/electrum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/electrum/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="book-hint btc">

&lt;p>This is a detailed guide on how to use the Electrum Bitcoin Wallet, with solutions to all its traps and quirks -something I’ve developed after several years of use, and teaching students about Bitcoin security/privacy. Electrum is not the best Bitcoin wallet for the person who wants to keep everything as simple as possible, and preferring to remain at the beginner level. Instead, it’s for the person who is, or aspires to be, a “power” user.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Wallets: How, Why and When to Hold Your Own Private Keys</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/how-to-hold-private-keys/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/how-to-hold-private-keys/</guid><description>&lt;p>Not Your Keys, Not Your Bitcoin.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Alright so you’ve acquired some Bitcoin, now what’s the best way to store it? Here we’ll take you through the process of finding the right Bitcoin wallet for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although it seems like a straight­for­ward question, there is a surprising amount of nuance to consider. &lt;em>How much Bitcoin do you have? How often do you plan to spend it? Are you confi­dent your keys are more secure with you than with a regulated custo­di­an’s cold storage?&lt;/em> Answering these questions will help deter­mine the right solution for you. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LNbits: A Swiss knife among Lightning apps</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/lnbits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/lnbits/</guid><description>&lt;p>LNbits is the Swiss knife among lightning apps – invoices, tips, paywalls, onchain wallet monitoring, event ticketing and more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at a wallet app accessible right from the browser that boasts so many features that it&amp;rsquo;s the envy of any software. This is LNbits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is worth starting with the fact that this service is still in the phase of active development, and some functionality is yet to be implemented. The most expected innovation is the possibility to enter the service via login and password. So far, LNbits is a web page that requires only a clearnet address to log in. Some may find this approach unacceptable, but in this guide we&amp;rsquo;ll look at approaches that completely negate any danger. Nevertheless, it&amp;rsquo;s worth remembering that this is not a tool for long-term savings, but rather a layer designed to facilitate interaction with other users and make everyone&amp;rsquo;s experience pleasant and seamless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Bitcoin</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/start/guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/start/guide/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="book-hint btc">

&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Let me explain quickly that a Bitcoin node is any computer which runs a piece of software (Bitcoin Core) that has some important jobs:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your Bitcoin node needs to keep a copy of the entire Bitcoin &lt;a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-blockchain">blockchain&lt;/a>. It has to connect with other nodes, forming a network of communication, which propagates transactions (transactions are kept in a “mempool”, i.e., the queue of transactions waiting to be included in the next block, and thus added to the blockchain). It needs to check that all additions to the blockchain are valid, and reject those that are not valid. It will provide details about the blockchain — such as balances — to other types of software that ask, like wallets. And it will provide a copy of the blockchain to any new node that wants to join. The new node then independently checks that every transaction in the copy it receives is valid. It does not actually “trust” the connected node.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Installing Blue Wallet</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/blue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/blue/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="book-hint btc">

&lt;p>If you have an iPhone and have bitcoin, then I highly recommend using &lt;a href="https://bluewallet.io/">Blue Wallet&lt;/a> to secure your BTC. This article will walk you through the basic steps for installing, securing and using Blue Wallet on iPhone. But, before getting started, it is a good idea to have a pen and paper ready. Remember to start with small amounts of bitcoin until these concepts make more sense and you are comfortable putting your funds in a mobile wallet. And always backup your seed phrase!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Buy noKYC Bitcoin with HodlHodl</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/hodl-hodl/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/hodl-hodl/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="book-hint btc">

However, Hodl Hodl is accessed via a web browser rather than a dedicated app. At the application layer, it requires no KYC information although certain sellers do require this. I would advise you to go with a seller that doesn’t ask for your selfie, after all, that’s why we’re here!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RoboSats: Private P2P Exchange</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/robosats/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/robosats/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="book-hint btc">
