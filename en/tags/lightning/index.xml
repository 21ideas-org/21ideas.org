The desire to travel far away and start a new currency will become a powerful driver of human expansion into space.
Earth will run on bitcoin, but colonies on Mars, the outer planets, and distant stars will not. Though faraway colonies will value and trade bitcoin, they will choose to launch, defend and use their own local blockchains.</description></item><item><title>How Lightning Address Works</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/how-lightning-address-works/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/how-lightning-address-works/</guid><description>More experienced users know, that nowadays you can send satoshis directly to Lightning Address in user@domain format.

This is Part III in a series of speculations about the hyperbitcoinized future. In Part I, we defined the First Law of Bitcoin Astronomy and described how it leads to new blockchains as humanity expands through the solar system. In Part II, we described a Second Law which leads to nested blockchains the size of solar systems and beyond, hashing vast energies on cosmic timescales.</description></item></channel></rss>
