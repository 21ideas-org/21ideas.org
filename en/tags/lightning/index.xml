&lt;p>I would like to share a guide on &lt;a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/">Phoenix&lt;/a> — the non-custodial Lightning wallet. This guide will be useful for those who already are familiar with the Lightning Network and have some experience using it. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;ve already been using a custodial wallet like &lt;a href="https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/">Wallet Of Satoshi&lt;/a> and you want to gain more control over your funds, hold your sats in Lightning Network, and &lt;strong>minimize&lt;/strong> the level of trust to a third party. I say &amp;lsquo;minimize&amp;rsquo; rather than &amp;lsquo;avoid&amp;rsquo; for a reason, but I&amp;rsquo;ll clarify this later in the guide.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is Lightning Network?</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/what-is-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/what-is-lightning-network/</guid><description>&lt;p>Why should you care about Lightning Network, how does it work and how to use it?

&lt;p>Lightning Network is a decentralized system for instant micro payments. Bitcoin, the world&amp;rsquo;s most widely used and valued cryptocurrency, allows anyone to transfer value without the need for a trusted third party. Bitcoin supports an advanced scripting system that allows users to program instructions for managing their funds. However, Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s design has a number of drawbacks. It can take an hour, and often more, from the time a transaction is made on the Bitcoin blockchain to the moment that transaction gets finalized.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part I</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/ba/1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/ba/1/</guid><description>&lt;details >&lt;summary>Contents&lt;/summary>

&lt;p>The desire to travel far away and start a new currency will become a powerful driver of human expansion into space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Earth will run on bitcoin, but colonies on Mars, the outer planets, and distant stars will not.  Though faraway colonies will value and trade bitcoin, they will choose to launch, defend and use their own local blockchains.  This pattern of replication is an inevitable consequence of &lt;a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/">hyperbitcoinization&lt;/a> and the physical limitations inherent to any blockchain that respects the finite speed of light.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lightning Wallets</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/lightning-wallets/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/lightning-wallets/</guid><description>&lt;p>With repeated bumps of the popularity of monkey JPEGs on the Bitcoin blockchain and in anticipation of the upcoming bull market, onchain fees are a thing to consider in the upcoming future.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="imageWrapper">
 &lt;img src="https://21ideas.org/img/ln-wallets/high-fees.png">
&lt;p>&lt;em>Fees in the network can reach hundreds of sats per virtual byte, and this is far from the limit. &lt;a href="https://mempool.space/">Source&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Lightning Network provides a solution to the painful problem of high fees, but you need to act thoughtfully, without rushing. That&amp;rsquo;s why today I suggest to analyze the best available Lightning wallets and evaluate the pros and cons of each wallet, so that you can choose the best solution and finally forget about high fees (or at least minimize the stress).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LNbits: A Swiss knife among Lightning apps</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/lnbits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/lnbits/</guid><description>&lt;p>LNbits is the Swiss knife among lightning apps – invoices, tips, paywalls, onchain wallet monitoring, event ticketing and more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at a wallet app accessible right from the browser that boasts so many features that it&amp;rsquo;s the envy of any software. This is LNbits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is worth starting with the fact that this service is still in the phase of active development, and some functionality is yet to be implemented. The most expected innovation is the possibility to enter the service via login and password. So far, LNbits is a web page that requires only a clearnet address to log in. Some may find this approach unacceptable, but in this guide we&amp;rsquo;ll look at approaches that completely negate any danger. Nevertheless, it&amp;rsquo;s worth remembering that this is not a tool for long-term savings, but rather a layer designed to facilitate interaction with other users and make everyone&amp;rsquo;s experience pleasant and seamless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Lightning Address Works</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/how-lightning-address-works/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/how-lightning-address-works/</guid><description>&lt;p>More experienced users know, that nowadays you can send satoshis directly to Lightning Address in user@domain format.

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Lightning Invoices are nowadays the standard for sending and receiving funds on the Lightning Network. If you want to receive some satoshis, you have to generate an invoice on your node/wallet. An invoice is nothing more than a text string (which starts with lnbc&amp;hellip;) and contains, among other things, the recipient ID and the amount. There is actually more information but we won&amp;rsquo;t go into that now. The invoice is most often shared using a QR code, which is nothing more than an image representation of the string described earlier.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part II</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/ba/2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/ba/2/</guid><description>&lt;details >&lt;summary>Contents&lt;/summary>

&lt;p>This is Part III in a series of speculations about the hyperbitcoinized future. In &lt;a href="https://21ideas.org/en/ba/1">Part I&lt;/a>, we defined the First Law of Bitcoin Astronomy and described how it leads to new blockchains as humanity expands through the solar system. In &lt;a href="https://21ideas.org/en/ba/2">Part II&lt;/a>, we described a Second Law which leads to nested blockchains the size of solar systems and beyond, hashing vast energies on cosmic timescales.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Starting with Mutiny Wallet</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/mutiny/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/mutiny/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I listened to an episode of &lt;a href="https://fountain.fm/episode/JLUwVlKLRjkUpbffvQEC">SLP551&lt;/a> featuring a discussion between &lt;a href="https://stacker.news/stephanlivera">@stephanlivera&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://stacker.news/benthecarman">@benthecarman&lt;/a> about Mutiny Wallet.
