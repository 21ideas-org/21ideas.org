&lt;p>Lightning Network is a decentralized system for instant micro payments. Bitcoin, the world&amp;rsquo;s most widely used and valued cryptocurrency, allows anyone to transfer value without the need for a trusted third party. Bitcoin supports an advanced scripting system that allows users to program instructions for managing their funds. However, Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s design has a number of drawbacks. It can take an hour, and often more, from the time a transaction is made on the Bitcoin blockchain to the moment that transaction gets finalized.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lightning Wallets</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/lightning-wallets/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/lightning-wallets/</guid><description>&lt;p>With repeated bumps of the popularity of monkey JPEGs on the Bitcoin blockchain and in anticipation of the upcoming bull market, onchain fees are a thing to consider in the upcoming future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Fees in the network can reach hundreds of sats per virtual byte, and this is far from the limit. &lt;a href="https://mempool.space/">Source&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Lightning Network provides a solution to the painful problem of high fees, but you need to act thoughtfully, without rushing. That&amp;rsquo;s why today I suggest to analyze the best available Lightning wallets and evaluate the pros and cons of each wallet, so that you can choose the best solution and finally forget about high fees (or at least minimize the stress).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Lightning Address Works</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/how-lightning-address-works/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/how-lightning-address-works/</guid><description>&lt;p>More experienced users know, that nowadays you can send satoshis directly to Lightning Address in user@domain format. But how exactly does this work?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this short article I would like to explain it to those who do not know it. At the same time, I will describe the basics of Lightning invoices and LNURL-pay protocol.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Lightning Invoices are nowadays the standard for sending and receiving funds on the Lightning Network. If you want to receive some satoshis, you have to generate an invoice on your node/wallet. An invoice is nothing more than a text string (which starts with lnbc&amp;hellip;) and contains, among other things, the recipient ID and the amount. There is actually more information but we won&amp;rsquo;t go into that now. The invoice is most often shared using a QR code, which is nothing more than an image representation of the string described earlier.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bitcoin is Not Too Slow</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/gradually-then-suddenly/bitcoin-is-not-too-slow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/gradually-then-suddenly/bitcoin-is-not-too-slow/</guid><description>&lt;details >&lt;summary>Contents&lt;/summary>
