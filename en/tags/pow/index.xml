One popular critique of bitcoin is energy cost per transaction. This doesn’t begin to capture bitcoin’s massive energy savings compared to fiat currency.
Bitcoin’s cost per transaction is well known, and often critiqued; one article in Wired magazine called bitcoin “[a] big middle finger to earth’s climate.” This is because bitcoin’s security, redundancy, and architecture are more energy intensive than traditional payments relying on a single point of failure.</description></item><item><title>Who Controls Bitcoin Core?</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/who-controls-bitcoin-core/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/who-controls-bitcoin-core/</guid><description>Understanding how the focal point of Bitcoin development operates.

if you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to consume this essay in audio format, you can listen to it here (narrated by Guy Swann of the Bitcoin Audible Podcast.)

This has been cited as a “central point of control” of the Bitcoin protocol by various parties over the years, but I argue that the question itself is a red herring that stems from an authoritarian perspective — this model does not apply to Bitcoin.</description></item></channel></rss>
