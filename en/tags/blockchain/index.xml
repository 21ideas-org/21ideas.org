The desire to travel far away and start a new currency will become a powerful driver of human expansion into space.
Earth will run on bitcoin, but colonies on Mars, the outer planets, and distant stars will not. Though faraway colonies will value and trade bitcoin, they will choose to launch, defend and use their own local blockchains.</description></item><item><title>Part II</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/ba/2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/ba/2/</guid><description>Contents ...

This is Part II in a series of speculations about the hyperbitcoinized future. In Part I, we defined the First Law of Bitcoin Astronomy and described how it incentivizes searching for energy to power our growing civilization.
In this part, we continue to follow the energy and speculate about how money and society coevolve as humanity expands through space.</description></item><item><title>Part III</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/ba/3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/ba/3/</guid><description>Contents ...

This is Part III in a series of speculations about the hyperbitcoinized future. In Part I, we defined the First Law of Bitcoin Astronomy and described how it leads to new blockchains as humanity expands through the solar system. In Part II, we described a Second Law which leads to nested blockchains the size of solar systems and beyond, hashing vast energies on cosmic timescales.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin, Not Blockchain</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/gradually-then-suddenly/bitcoin-not-blockchain/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/gradually-then-suddenly/bitcoin-not-blockchain/</guid><description>Contents ...

At least three of these incidents resulted in an identifiable chainsplit, lasting approximately 51, 24, and six blocks, in 2010, 2013 and 2015, respectively.

On March 11, 2013, Bitcoin experienced a technical crisis. Versions 0.7 and 0.8 of the software diverged from each other in behavior due to a bug, causing the block chain to “fork” into two. Considering how catastrophic a hard fork can be, the crisis was resolved quickly with remarkably little damage owing to the exemplary competence of the developers in charge.</description></item></channel></rss>
