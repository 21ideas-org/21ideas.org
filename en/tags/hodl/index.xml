If you have an iPhone and have bitcoin, then I highly recommend using Blue Wallet to secure your BTC. This article will walk you through the basic steps for installing, securing and using Blue Wallet on iPhone. But, before getting started, it is a good idea to have a pen and paper ready. Remember to start with small amounts of bitcoin until these concepts make more sense and you are comfortable putting your funds in a mobile wallet.</description></item><item><title>SeedSigner: DIY Bitcoin Signing Device</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/seedsigner/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/seedsigner/</guid><description>This comprehensive how-to guide walks you through unboxing, setting up and signing bitcoin transactions with the air-gapped SeedSigner device.
