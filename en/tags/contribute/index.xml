 A Community-driven project
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#a-community-driven-project">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>21ideas is a Bitcoin-only educational project managed by the community. Its concept revolves around having active Bitcoiners monitor the repository, ensuring that the list of moderators remains flexible, much like the keys to the Bitcoin kingdom are transferred to new maintainers as the project evolves. We envision this approach allowing the project to live eternally and remain forever relevant. Similar to Bitcoin itself, the project doesn&amp;rsquo;t require quick changes or updates. From the beginning, its purpose was to curate fundamental materials and essential information, catering both to beginners and seasoned Bitcoin enthusiasts alike.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
