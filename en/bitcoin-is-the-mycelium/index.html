<a class=anchor href=#foreward>#</a></h2><p>I need to give credit to Dan Held for publishing his 4-part series <a href=https://medium.com/@danhedl/planting-bitcoin-sound-money-72e80e40ff62>comparing bitcoin’s origin to planting a tree</a>. While I loved his series, I believe a more robust analogy is comparing bitcoin to fungi.

There are more fungi species than plants and animals combined.</p><p>Animals are more closely related to fungi than we are to plants. Both fungi and animals inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Plants produce their own food through photosynthesis (autotrophic) while animals and fungi must find their own food (heterotrophic). Animals evolved to have internal stomachs/brains whereas fungi pursued external stomachs/brains.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><strong>Fungi Fact #1</strong>: humans share over 50% of their DNA with fungi.

Most organize in an underground “root structure” called mycelium that’s found nearly everywhere on this planet.</p><p>When conditions are right, fungi produce mushrooms which then release spores (seeds) that attempt to colonize life in a nearby location. Mushrooms are simply the reproductive organ. Mushrooms are to the mycelium what apples are to a tree.</p><p>Fungi are paramount to life on earth:</p><ul><li>The <a href=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141114-the-biggest-organism-in-the-world>largest organism on our planet</a> is a fungal network</li><li>Fungi are the best chemists on our planet, much of our medicine comes from fungi</li><li>Trees cannot survive without underground fungal allies</li><li>Fungi have been around for <a href=http://science.psu.edu/news-and-events/2001-news/Hedges8-2001.htm>1.3b years</a> surviving all <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event>5 great extinction events</a></li><li>Fungi are capable of <a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32194-8>saving the bees</a></li></ul><h2 id=fungi-are-decentralized-intelligence-networks>Fungi are Decentralized Intelligence Networks
<a class=anchor href=#fungi-are-decentralized-intelligence-networks>#</a></h2><p>Fungal networks don’t have a centralized “brain.” Instead, they are a one-cell walled “root system” called Mycelium. This underground stomach and distributed intelligence network is capable of sending information bi-directionally over long distances and even across species lines. These fungal networks constantly evolve based on feedback from their environment.</p><p>At any one point, a fungal network contains millions of endpoints each searching for food, defending their territory, or inventing new molecules to subvert their competition (other fungi, bacteria, etc). These networks form a decentralized consensus on how to use resources, when to reproduce, and what strategy best defends the organism.</p><p>This mirrors the decentralized consensus (<a href="https://medium.com/@hasufly/bitcoins-social-contract-1f8b05ee24a9?sk=27e8cf65d45c46ffae1466ce2ac31b48">social contract</a>) formed in bitcoin. Nodes determine what software they wish to run and enforce the consensus rules they support accordingly. Miners determine which transactions to include in blocks. Exchanges, wallets, and merchants each steward large groups of users. Each participant in bitcoin voluntarily chooses how they wish to participate and the aggregate consensus represents the network.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/0000000003.png></div><h2 id=decentralized-networks-are-older-than-humanity>Decentralized Networks are Older Than Humanity

The impact created a cloud of smoke so thick that it blocked sunlight from reaching the earth’s surface for many years. Without sunlight, plants died off and with them most animals. Fungi however do not rely on sunlight to survive, they can adapt quickly, and can find their own food.</p><p>After each extinction event, fungi “inherit the earth” and slowly rebuild until conditions stabilize and life can continue again.</p><p>Bitcoin will become the most successful monetary specie because its decentralized, adapts (relatively) quickly, finds its own food (unmet demand), and doesn’t need government support. In the event of a mass monetary extinction event, bitcoin will “inherit the earth.”</p><h2 id=japanese-government-vs-the-humble-slime-mold>Japanese Government vs the Humble Slime Mold
<a class=anchor href=#japanese-government-vs-the-humble-slime-mold>#</a></h2><p>Whether it’s central banks trying to steer the economy or hierarchical corporations trying to maximize value in the information age… Central planning has many flaws.</p><p>When making decisions in the “information economy,” decentralized or flat organizations are more effective. They resist corruption, minimize bureaucracy, and push decision-making to the extremities where individuals (nodes) have the most up-to-date information about the problem at hand.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the Tokyo subway system to illustrate the power of decentralized networks.</p><p>Scientists conducted an <a href=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5964/439>experiment</a> where an ancient fungus (slime mold) was incentivized to recreate the Tokyo subway system. Each subway stop (node) was marked with the slime mold’s favorite food (oat flakes).</p><p>After a short while, the slime mold grew to connect all the nodes/stops in a more efficient design than the centrally planned committee of engineers hired by the Japanese government.</p><div class=imageWrapper><img src=/img/0000000004.jpg><p><em>Slime Mold designing Tokyo Subway System</em></p></div><p>From the <a href=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5964/439>Abstract</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks — in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.</p></blockquote><p>When you think of the costs and complexities involved in such an infrastructure project, it’s quite sobering to realize a slime mold can design a better network in a single day.</p><p><strong>Satoshi understood the power of the slime mold.</strong></p><p>Bitcoin is a non-sovereign monetary good that pushes complexity and decision-making to the edge just like fungi. Over time, this free market decentralization allows bitcoin to out-compete various legacy financial systems who have little skin in the game, suffer from the innovator’s dilemma, become more fragile over time, and often drown in bureaucracy (or worse).</p><h2 id=life-without-a-centralized-point-of-failure>Life Without a Centralized Point of Failure
<a class=anchor href=#life-without-a-centralized-point-of-failure>#</a></h2><p>Mycelium has no “central point of control.” Any individual part can be removed but the system as a whole survives.</p><blockquote><p>“If you come at the king, you best not miss.”</p><p>— Omar Little (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire>The Wire</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Nation states and central banks face a paradoxical challenge. If they attempt to destroy their competition, they’ll highlight the very need for bitcoin in the first place. And yet, the longer they wait, the stronger bitcoin becomes.</p><h2 id=hardened-from-hostility>Hardened from hostility
<a class=anchor href=#hardened-from-hostility>#</a></h2><p>Both mycelium and bitcoin endure in the most competitive ecosystems on our planet and must constantly adapt in order to survive. They have skin in the game and become hardened from hostility.</p><p>Fungi are in a 24/7 competitive environment, constantly fighting little underground battles against various bacteria, microbes, and competing fungi.</p><p>If one mycelial “node” senses a predator/prey, it sends information to the “mushroom scientists” who then create a new enzyme to target the predator/prey. The fungal network distributes this new enzyme where needed.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><strong>Fungi fact #2</strong>: As humans, we benefit from medicinal compounds created by fungi. Most famously: Penicillin, which came from an <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4520913/>accidental discovery by Alexander Fleming</a>. Penicillin has been used to combat bacterial epidemics that historically have decimated human populations. Since the discovery of Penicillin our population has tripled.</blockquote><p>Bitcoin responds to its environment in a similar manner. As bugs/threats/opportunities are found in the system, information travels to the “bitcoin scientists” (developers) who create an “enzyme” (software patch) and this update propagates through the system. This enables greater ecology success for bitcoin too. Bitcoin is antifragile.</p><p>Both fungi and bitcoin harden their defenses over time and learn to consume new food sources. This has a compounding effect increasing antifragility as well as life expectancy over time.</p><p>In one extreme case, let’s take a look at the <a href=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141114-the-biggest-organism-in-the-world>largest organism on our planet, the Honey Mushroom (Armillaria sp)</a>. Found in the Blue Mountains in Eastern Oregon, this single organism is over 2.4 miles (3.8 km) across. It’s estimated to be between 1,900 and 8,650 years old and is currently consuming an entire forest.</p><h2 id=dealing-with-competition>Dealing with Competition
<a class=anchor href=#dealing-with-competition>#</a></h2><p>Fungal networks steal competitive advantages from their neighbors in the form of genetic information just like bitcoin absorbs competitive advantages displayed by altcoins.</p><p>There is a (misguided) belief in which people assume that altcoins will implement cool new features that will eventually outcompete bitcoin.</p><p>The opposing camp believes that bitcoin will eventually absorb all the best features after they’ve been tested in the market which makes alternative currencies unable to compete over the long term. I stand in this camp.</p><p><strong>Let’s take a look at how fungi approach their competition…</strong></p><p>First, we need to understand some basic genetics. Genes are typically passed down from parent to offspring in what’s known as “Vertical Gene Transfer.”</p><p>Interestingly, fungi perform “Horizontal Gene transfer” — effectively slurping up genetic information from different species competing in the same ecosystem.</p><p>This process of horizontal gene transfer demonstrated by fungi foreshadows the future state where bitcoin integrates any proven ideas produced by altcoins at large.</p><p><strong>For example</strong>: Combining the <a href=https://lightningjoule.com/>Lightning Joule Browser extension</a> with a node (<a href=https://github.com/PierreRochard/node-launcher/releases>launch your own</a>, use <a href=https://keys.casa/>Casa</a>, or otherwise) enables micro-transactions through your browser. This effectively eliminates the need for tokens like BAT.</p><p>You could even make the argument that bitcoin has been performing horizontal gene transfer since Satoshi first combined technologies used in previous attempts at electronic cash systems such as Hash Cash, E-gold, etc.</p><h2 id=arbitrage-incentives-and-finding-their-place-in-ecology>Arbitrage, Incentives, and Finding Their Place in Ecology
<a class=anchor href=#arbitrage-incentives-and-finding-their-place-in-ecology>#</a></h2><p>Fungi perform two ecological roles on this planet: they recycle all matter into base elements & act as our planet’s immune system.</p><blockquote><p>“Mycelia are the grand disassemblers of nature.”</p><p>— Paul Stamets</p></blockquote><p>Fungi spend their days quietly decomposing organic matter. They transform rocks, branches, leaf litter, dead animals, and oil spills into their base elements (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, etc). Then fungi trade these valuable elements with nearby organisms.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><strong>Fungi fact #3</strong>: Our forests would be buried in hundreds of feet of leaves and branches if fungi didn’t decompose them and redistribute the nutrients.</blockquote><p>In other words, fungi unlock stranded resources. A tree cannot re-use its own leaves or branches as the carbon/nitrogen/phosphorus is locked in an unusable form. Fungi exploit arbitrage opportunities in their ecosystem.</p><h2 id=bitcoin-through-its-pow-mechanism-unlocks-stranded-resources-in-the-form-of-energy>Bitcoin, Through its PoW Mechanism, Unlocks Stranded Resources in the Form of Energy
<a class=anchor href=#bitcoin-through-its-pow-mechanism-unlocks-stranded-resources-in-the-form-of-energy>#</a></h2><p>Before we tackle bitcoin, let’s explore a fascinating historical example: How aluminum was used to “export stranded renewable energy” from a country like Iceland.</p><p>Iceland produces renewable geothermal energy, often in remote places. This leads to an excess supply that cannot reach the demand (energy doesn’t travel well over long distances).</p><p>Iceland took advantage of its excess energy by producing aluminum, which is a very energy-intensive process. Iceland effectively turns excess energy into a durable store of value (Aluminum) which can be exported.</p><p>Bitcoin does the same thing. Instead of stranded energy “dying on the vine,” producers can mine bitcoin (or just sell excess energy to miners). This, too, enables excess energy production to be turned into a durable store of value. The second-order effect is that bitcoin is effectively subsidizing renewable energy projects.</p><p>To explore this concept in-depth, check out Dan Held’s Article: <a href=https://blog.picks.co/pow-is-efficient-aa3d442754d3>PoW is Efficient</a>.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><strong>Fungi Fact #4</strong>: Fungi eating rocks is the main reason we have topsoil.

It’s impossible to know until the day it suffers a coordinated attack by a state-level actor. However, Bitcoin is the only existing cryptocurrency that stands a chance.

Each country has its own competing jurisdiction.</li><li><strong>Game theory protects Bitcoin from a global coordinated attack.</strong> Nation-states compete with each other. Unlikely to see top nations cooperate. If the US bans BTC, China has an incentive to adopt. Nations not benefiting from the current USD regime have an incentive to adopt BTC.</li><li><strong>Bitcoin’s PoW protects the ledger with an “energy shield.”</strong> By anchoring Bitcoin to real economic value (energy), the only way to change the ledger is to “re-do all the work” aka spend the same amount of money in the form of electricity. h/t <a href=https://twitter.com/danheld>@danheld</a></li><li><strong>Bitcoin inspires a religious fervor from its supporters</strong>. Ideologically motivated “hardliners” act as an immune system. Surviving the scaling wars (NYA/S2X) demonstrates this. Bitcoiners “provide cover fire” until Bitcoin gets through the door. (h/t Bitcoin Sign Guy)</li><li><strong>Bitcoin can route around ISP censorship.</strong> Bitcoin has a growing network of alternatives to the mainstream internet (mesh networks, HAM radios, and satellites). Maybe even routing transactions through a mycelial network(theoretically possible).</li><li><strong>Bitcoin is an idea, ideas are eternal.</strong> Bitcoin spreads like a mind virus. Even if somehow the current form was “killed,” the idea will live forever. “This Snow Crash thing — is it a virus, a drug, or a religion?” Juanita shrugs. ‘What’s the difference?’” h/t <a href=https://twitter.com/nealstephenson>@nealstephenson</a></li><li><strong>Bitcoin’s privacy improvements reduce taxability.</strong> CoinJoins and other privacy technologies will minimize the ability for governments to attack Bitcoin through predatory tax legislation. Thank you <a href=https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet>@wasabiwallet</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet>@SamouraiWallet</a></li><li><strong>Bitcoin minimizes the ability to cheat.</strong> Bitcoin doesn’t rely on trust. Think “can’t be changed” instead of trusting that a system “won’t be changed.” Bitcoin recognizes leaders, formalized governance, and concentration of power as attack vectors waiting to be exploited.</li><li><strong>Nation-states underestimate Bitcoin.</strong> This buys time for Bitcoin to get stronger + harder to kill. The hegemonic banking system is digging their own grave with shovel made of 100% pure hubris. If only we had a ₿ackup plan</li></ul><p>So far, we haven’t seen any serious state-level attack on Bitcoin. However, if Bitcoin continues to absorb value there is an incentive to attack it.

No. They simply mistake Blockchain Hype (Mushroom) for Bitcoin (Mycelial Network).</p><p>We should first attempt to educate them as most people were not born Bitcoiners. That being said, deliberate scammers deserve to be flamed.</p><p><strong>How the “blockchain industry” helps Bitcoin…</strong></p><p>Blockchainers tie up government resources, train future developers, confuse incumbent businesses, and lull banksters to sleep.</p><p>Banks like JP Morgan will train hundreds of blockchain developers. Eventually, they’ll discover Bitcoin and say goodbye to boring bank coin & and instead join the peaceful revolution. JP Morgan is funding their own demise? How poetic.</p><p>Zuckerberg will soon put a “crypto wallet” in everyone’s pocket. Instead of competing with Bitcoin, ZuckBucks may actually attempt to compete with USD. Either way, it gets people comfortable with non-state money on their phone similar to WeChat and Alipay. The first widespread censorship of ZuckBucks will nicely demonstrate the need for BTC in the first place.</p><p>Blockchainers and scammers claim Bitcoin is old and can’t scale. It’s Beanie Babies and myspace. They paint Bitcoin as a friendly, but limited-use fungus, that “brought us the blockchain.”</p><p>While the blockchain zeitgeist chases their tail, Bitcoin is quietly growing underground, fusing with the “roots” of the legacy finance system, building resilience, recruiting volunteers, infecting curious minds like a cordyceps mushroom, and preparing for “The Great Filter.”</p><p>If we’re lucky, Blockchainers will distract global superpowers just long enough for Bitcoin to become “too big to fail.”</p><h1 id=chapter-4-bitcoin-is-a-catalyst-for-human-evolution-symbiosis>Chapter 4: Bitcoin is a Catalyst for Human Evolution (Symbiosis)

Organisms are classified as either <em>Autotrophic</em> or <em>Heterotrophic</em>.</p><p><em>Autotrophs</em> are organisms that make their food. For example: plants convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into food via photosynthesis.</p><p><em>Heterotrophs</em> are organisms that find their food. For example: lions eat gazelles and fungi produce enzymes to externally digest their environment.</p><p>Like human settlers, organisms colonizing new territory are most vulnerable in the early days. In order for fungi to colonize dry land (terra), they needed to secure a reliable food source.</p><p>Fungi effectively domesticated photosynthesis machines (algae) to harness a self-sustaining food source. We can think of these algae as little solar panels bolted onto fungal networks which made colonizing virgin dry land possible.</p><p>Soon after getting established, the fungi began digesting the volcanic rock upon which they sat. This ultimately liberated valuable nutrients which were then traded with other nearby fungi, algae, bacteria, etc. Together, these early settlers bootstrapped life on dry land.

Increasing trade leads to increased specialization (division of labor), further increasing biodiversity (wealth and resilience) in the ecosystem.</p><p>Currently, our governments form economic monopolies which prevent many citizens from accessing the global markets.</p><p>Think about all the unproductive human capital siloed in countries like Iran, Venezuela, and Argentina. Without access to a common economic language (Bitcoin) many people are unable to participate in global trade.</p><p>As Bitcoin becomes ubiquitous, it unleashes human productivity leading to increased innovation, specialization, and trade.

When the antelope gets eaten by the lion, it dies, no one bails out the antelope. Nature has skin in the game. This feedback loop is crucial. Individuals are fragile in order to ensure the system is antifragile.</p><p>Market-based economics is an engine designed to seek more efficient uses of capital by rewarding successful ventures and punishing the unsuccessful. However, our current form of “capitalism” is more like cronyism or as <a href="https://twitter.com/Travis_Kling?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Travis Kling</a> said: “socialism for the rich.”</p><p>Instead of letting companies fail, we bail them out. This results in broken incentives which create a moral hazard making the entire system more fragile. Not to mention, disproportionately hurting the working class. <em>Heads I win, tails you lose</em>.</p><p>A sound money system (like Bitcoin) improves this economic engine by tightening the feedback mechanism that rewards value creation and punishes failure. In a Bitcoin world, bailouts aren’t really possible because monetary expansion is restrained by a fixed monetary base. Bitcoin ensures individual people/companies are fragile in order to ensure the economic system remains antifragile.</p><p>In other words, Bitcoin increases economic “skin in the game” which improves the feedback loop leading to economic evolution by natural selection. Economic Darwinism for the win.</p><h2 id=taming-of-the-tenrec>Taming of the Tenrec

<a class=anchor href=#what-about-the-tenrec>#</a></h2><p>As temperatures declined and food became scarce, most animals who survived the initial shock were killed by fungal pathogens or eventually starved to death as the global food chain seized up. However, not the Tenrec.</p><p>Tenrecs are humble shrew-like mammals that lived underground which protected them from hostile conditions on the surface. Their favorite foods (insects and aquatic plants) were relatively unaffected.</p><p>Tenrecs are capable of <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4213634/>hibernating for up to 9 months at a time</a>. This protects them from short-term volatility and enables them to outlast their competition. <em>The best offense is a good defense</em>.</p><p>Bitcoin reminds me of the tenrec, both live underground and thrive on volatility.

Logically, each state prefers to settle debts in their own currency. We’re already seeing cracks in the dollar hegemony coming out of places like China, Russia, and Iran. Bitcoin is well suited for this problem.</p><p>Bitcoin is fully auditable, hard-capped, and offers final settlement quickly. The perfect neutral money for untrusting nation-states to settle debts. Under this light, Bitcoin is money for enemies.</p><p>It’s time to upgrade humanity by forming symbiosis with Bitcoin.</p><h2 id=lets-wrap-up>Let’s Wrap Up
<a class=anchor href=#lets-wrap-up>#</a></h2><p>The story of life on earth can be summed up as: success comes to those who form symbiotic relationships with network-based organisms (particularly fungi).</p><p>As humble apes, it’s our duty to form a symbiotic relationship with Bitcoin. We must strive to understand this phenomenon so that we may shepherd her through adolescence.</p><p>Just like fungi colonizing dry land was the catalyst for biological evolution on terra, Bitcoin is a catalyst for human evolution.</p><p>Let’s embrace Bitcoin or suffer the fate of the dinosaurs.</p><p>Thank you,<br>Brandon</p><h3 id=ps-whos-driving-the-ship>P.S. Who’s driving the ship?
<a class=anchor href=#ps-whos-driving-the-ship>#</a></h3><p>Fungi enabled complex life on earth, which eventually gave way to humans. Now humans are creating the internet (and Bitcoin) which both embody the same mycelial archetype of which we came.</p><p>We didn’t consciously choose to mimic mycelial networks in these designs. However, animals did taxonomically branch off from fungi millions of years ago. Humans came full circle, the student became the teacher.</p><p>Was this inevitable?</p><p>The mycelial archetype appears to be embedded into our species. Over time, network-based structures continually appear whether due to embedded wisdom or blind luck. These Mycelial inspired network technologies, once discovered, seem to persist due to their antifragile nature.</p><p>Many people claim we “discovered Bitcoin.” I’m sympathetic to this idea, however it’s more accurate to say we _re_discovered Bitcoin. The mycelial archetype is an emergent property of biology which means Bitcoin was inevitable.</p><h3 id=acknowledgments>Acknowledgments
