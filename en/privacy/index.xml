“There is a sacred realm of privacy for every man and woman where he makes his choices and decisions — a realm of his own essen­tial rights and liber­ties into which the law, gener­ally speaking, must not intrude.”

Background # Bitcoin transactions are public by nature; they map inputs (unspent utxo’s) to outputs (new unspent utxo’s) in a way that is auditable by anyone with access to the bitcoin blockchain (the history of transactions). Yet interpreting these transactions and the Blockchain is a non-trivial task, because Bitcoin transaction are not equivalent to Bitcoin payments.

Okay, so basically it&amp;rsquo;s just my views as to the current state of Bitcoin fungibility. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to avoid any stream of consciousness stuff and get right to the point.
I’ll start off with playing a devil’s advocate. Perhaps, all of our problems with fungibility is our fault, maybe we dropped the ball and allowed Bitcoin to be defined as &amp;ldquo;money&amp;rdquo; by the state.</description></item><item><title>#FreeSamourai</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/freesamourai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/freesamourai/</guid><description>Samourai Wallet&amp;rsquo;s founders were arrested, indicted, and charged despite following the law.
