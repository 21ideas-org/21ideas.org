 What is KYC?
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#what-is-kyc">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>KYC or ‘Know your customer’ is a regulation that any businesses with a banking relationship has to abide by. Bitcoin exchanges are no different. These rules are imposed worldwide and are geared towards ensuring that a business acting as a money exchange and/or transmitter has ‘suitable’ information on every customer they serve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within the Bitcoin space, ‘creeping KYC’ is a disease that is slowly spreading. If you purchase through one of these regulated entities, you essentially tag your bitcoin addresses to your personal identity. This makes it trivial for chain surveillance firms, the companies they work with, or worse, governments, to potentially…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Privacy</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/wiki-bitcoin-privacy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/wiki-bitcoin-privacy/</guid><description>&lt;p>While Bitcoin can support strong &lt;strong>privacy&lt;/strong>, many ways of using it are usually not very private. With a proper understanding of the technology, bitcoin can indeed be used in a very private and anonymous way.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As of 2019 most casual enthusiasts of bitcoin believe it is perfectly traceable; this is completely false. Around 2011 most casual enthusiasts believed it is totally private; which is also false. There is some nuance - in certain situations, bitcoin can be very private. But it is not simple to understand, and it takes some time and reading.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Becomes Critical</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/bitcoin-becomes-critical/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/bitcoin-becomes-critical/</guid><description>&lt;p>An EU draft resolution calling for a “balance” between encryption and surveillance once again underscored the need for technologies like Bitcoin.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On November 6, 2020, the Council of the European Union released a “&lt;a href="https://files.orf.at/vietnam2/files/fm4/202045/783284_fh_st12143-re01en20_783284.pdf">Draft Council Resolution on Encryption&lt;/a>.” The document is supposed to serve as a precursor to a final text to be presented to the Council, on November 19 for potential legal adoption. It emphasizes support for data encryption in general, but also notes the challenges that encryption technologies pose for investigators who want to access criminals’ communications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BIP47, the ugly duckling</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/bip47-the-ugly-duckling/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/bip47-the-ugly-duckling/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="book-hint btc">

&lt;p>Bitcoin transactions are public by nature; they map inputs (unspent utxo’s) to outputs (new unspent utxo’s) in a way that is auditable by anyone with access to the bitcoin blockchain (the history of transactions). Yet interpreting these transactions and the Blockchain is a non-trivial task, because Bitcoin transaction are not equivalent to Bitcoin payments.&lt;/p>

 The Problem
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#the-problem">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Because anyone can see the links between transaction inputs and outputs it’s possible for anyone to analyse previous and future transaction behavior in an attempt to link multiple Bitcoin addresses to the same entity, this process is sometimes called clustering.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Fungibility</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/bitcoin-fungibility/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/bitcoin-fungibility/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="book-hint btc">

&lt;p>Okay, so basically it&amp;rsquo;s just my views as to the current state of Bitcoin fungibility. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to avoid any stream of consciousness stuff and get right to the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="imageWrapper">
 &lt;img src="https://21ideas.org/img/bitcoin-fungibility/02.png">
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I’ll start off with playing a devil’s advocate. Perhaps, all of our problems with fungibility is our fault, maybe we dropped the ball and allowed Bitcoin to be defined as &amp;ldquo;money&amp;rdquo; by the state. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s true that we took a cue from Satoshi, who wrote a white paper about digital cash, but we took that ball and we ran with it. We could have early on fought to keep Bitcoin defined as text. Wallets, for example, are nothing more than keychains. And while all of that is highly technical for some and does not play well to mass adoption, keeping Bitcoin defined as a text-based solution would have been one way of keeping regulatory capture at bay, as long as this thing was not perceived to be money.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#FreeSamourai</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/freesamourai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/freesamourai/</guid><description>&lt;p>Samourai Wallet&amp;rsquo;s founders were arrested, indicted, and charged despite following the law.
