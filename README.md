## About 

[21 ideas](https://21ideas.org) is the most exhaustive multilingual library of Bitcoin materials. Everyone can suggest improvements, corrections or new materials - be it translations of articles, books, videos or audio. You can also suggest own materials. The project is curated by the most active members of the community and is non-profit. Nevertheless, we reward contributors with sats whenever possible.

Alternatively, you can send the desired amount to one of the addresses listed [here](https://21ideas.org/contribute/) and specify the purpose of the donation.
